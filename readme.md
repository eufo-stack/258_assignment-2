# RentTheRunway Item Ratings Sentiment Analysis with Recommender Systems

The objective of this work is to build a model that combines
a recommender system with sentiment analysis to improve
rating predictions. We leverage features conventional to recommender systems, but also integrate text models to build a
final model with a more nuanced understanding of individual
user preferences.
